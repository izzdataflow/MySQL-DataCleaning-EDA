MySQL Data Cleaning Process Logs

1.Open MySQL, connect to server

2.Create new schema, named it world_layoffs

3.Import data : world_layoffs -> table data import wizard -> create new table -> correct data type (for this project i'm not changing anything so its raw data) -> after finishing, refresh schema

4.List plan for cleaning data : remove duplicates,standardize the data, null values or blank values, remove any columns

4.world layoffs database -> create layoffs_staging table for raw data before cleaning it -> make sure include all column

6.Insert data from layoffs to layoffs_staging

7.We do all the process with layoffs_staging table not the layoffs table for best practice

8.Remove duplicate rows(queries) : Create CTEs, Create layoffs_staging2, inserting CTEs earlier into layoffs_staging_2, delete duplicate rows(setting SAFE mode off)

9.Standardiziing data : TRIM,  SET similar rows from each column into one, changing data type based on rows(`date` column from text to DATE data type)

10.Updating or Removing  NULL values or blank values based on data we have on table

11.Remove temporary column that used for cleaning data
